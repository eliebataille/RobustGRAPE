# RobustGRAPE.jl

*A Julia package for robust quantum optimal control using the GRAPE algorithm*

## Overview

RobustGRAPE.jl is a package for optimizing quantum control pulses using the GRadient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) algorithm, with additional features for robustness against noise and errors. The package is designed for optimizing control pulses for quantum gates in systems like Rydberg atoms, trapped ions, and superconducting qubits.

## Features

- Optimization of quantum control pulses for high-fidelity gates
- Robustness against various error sources and noise
- Frequency domain analysis of robustness
- Support for arbitrary Hamiltonians and quantum systems
- Efficient gradient calculations for optimization
- Various regularization techniques for pulse smoothing

## Installation

To install the package, use the Julia package manager:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("RobustGRAPE")
```

Or to install the development version from the repository:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/USERNAME/RobustGRAPE.jl")
```

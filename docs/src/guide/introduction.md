# Introduction

## What is GRAPE?

GRadient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) is a numerical optimal control algorithm for designing control pulses in quantum systems. It was first introduced by Khaneja et al. in 2005 and has since become one of the standard tools in quantum control.

The algorithm works by:  
1. Parameterizing control pulses (typically as piecewise constant functions)
2. Computing the gradient of a fidelity function with respect to pulse parameters
3. Using gradient-based optimization to maximize fidelity

## What is Robust GRAPE?

Robust GRAPE extends the standard GRAPE algorithm to include robustness against various sources of error and noise. This is achieved by optimizing not only the fidelity of the quantum operation but also its sensitivity to perturbations.

The key features of Robust GRAPE include:

- **Error robustness**: Optimization against specific error models
- **Frequency domain analysis**: Understanding sensitivity to noise at different frequencies
- **Regularization**: Ensuring smooth and experimentally feasible control pulses

## Applications

RobustGRAPE.jl is particularly suited for optimizing quantum gates in systems such as:

- Rydberg atom arrays
- Trapped ions
- Superconducting qubits
- NMR systems

These systems often require precise control in the presence of noise and experimental limitations.

# Examples

## Time-Optimal CZ Gate

This example shows how to optimize a CZ gate in a Rydberg atom system with minimal gate time.

```julia
# Example will be based on examples/time_optimal_cz.jl
```

## Robust Control Pulse Design

This example demonstrates designing control pulses that are robust against specific noise sources.

```julia
# Example showing robustness optimization
```

## Frequency Domain Analysis

This example shows how to analyze the frequency response of optimized control pulses to understand their robustness characteristics.

```julia
# Example using calculate_fidelity_response_fft
```
